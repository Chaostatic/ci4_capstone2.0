The people then in distant places went about their lives unaware of a great place which lay on the northern part of Tayabas Bay and on the northeastern part of the Sierra Madre mountain range. The accidental discovery of the place was a result of the search for fortune, the trial of the braves and hardy pioneers who wanted to build new homes in the wilderness to be called their own. The place was then thick jungle where all wild native animals roamed. Travel in those days was so hard and dangerous that most natives were content to stay at home. But there were some who wanted to explore and learn more about the neighboring regions.</span><br></p>";s:7:"visible";s:1:"1";}}__ci_vars|a:3:{s:13:"_ci_old_input";s:3:"old";s:21:"_ci_validation_errors";s:3:"old";s:6:"errors";s:3:"old";}_ci_validation_errors|a:1:{s:5:"image";s:35:"image is not a valid uploaded file.";}errors|a:1:{s:5:"image";s:35:"image is not a valid uploaded file.";}
